## 🛠️ Important Commands

These are the essential scripts for development and deployment.

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm install` | Installs all necessary dependencies. |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the local development server at `localhost:5173`. |
| `npm run build` | Bundles the project into the `/dist` folder for production. |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build locally to check for errors. |

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure the code is functional and bug-free, use the following commands:

* **Unit Testing:** `npm run test` (Runs Vitest to verify individual functions).
* **Manual Testing:** Run `npm run dev` and check the browser console for errors.
* **Build Check:** Always run `npm run build` before pushing to GitHub to ensure the production bundle generates correctly.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `/public` - Static assets not processed by Vite like your favicon.
* `index.html` - The entry point for the browser.
